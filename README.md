This was a project for my Database Information Systems cource I took over the Fall 2023 during my Senior Year. Our project was to create 2 distinct databases on SQL.
One called the Owner Table and another called the Vehicle Table. On the Owner table, we have to populate with 5 records whilst on the Vehicle table we have to populate with 10 records.
Both tables are related in some form. You know how? Is because theirs a Foreign Key called Owner_ID table that is references with the Owner Table. I also had to make queries to arrange 
certain Collumns from the Vehicle Table in certain order by using the OrderBy command such as ordering the Vehicles, Manufacturer Order, etc.
